Hangout Chromage
========

Chrome extension for Google Hangouts which converts image links into actual images.

## Do I need this?
If you are boring that you have to click all the links in hangouts for those funny gifs, then yes. It also comes handy when you get a link of an image, and you want a sneak peak of it in the small chat window.

## Is it working?
That's the goal. I hate clicking.

## How should I install it?
First you need to use Google Chrome. After that download the extension ([here]( https://github.com/tiborbotos/chromage/raw/master/extension/chromage-1.0.0.crx)), and just open it.

## Any plans with it?
Yes, all kind of smart stuff, like pre-loading facebook images if someone sends link from there, or pretty much everything what should google do with the smart link resolvation (like youtube or google+ content).
