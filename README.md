Hangouts Inset
========

Chrome extension for Google Hangouts which converts image links into actual images.

## Do I need this?
If you are boring that you have to click all the links in hangouts for those funny gifs, then yes. It also comes handy when you get a link of an image, and you want a sneak peak of it in the small chat window.

## Is it working?
That's the goal. I hate clicking.

## How should I install it?
* You need to use Google Chrome
* Download the extension ([here](https://github.com/tiborbotos/hangouts-inset/raw/master/extension/hangouts-inset-1.1.0.crx))
* Open google chrome's extension [tab](chrome://extensions/)
* Install the downloaded file

## Any plans with it?
Yes, all kind of smart stuff, like pre-loading main image from a website if someone sends a link, or pretty much everything what should google do with the smart link resolvation (like youtube or google+ content).
